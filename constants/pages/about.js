        `My story is filled with monstrous bugs 🐞, amazing features ✨, large scale products ⛰️, many programming languages and frameworks 📚, huge infrastructures 🗼 and amazing colleagues 👨‍💻.`,
        `As employee I started as Software Engineer and then joined the Dark Side of DevOps and Site Reliability taking the best from both worlds (I've never stopped to use the --force).`,
        `The reason I decided to start my journey in 2021 as a freelance professional was to help both individuals and companies to learn from their mistakes and drawing insights from them.`,
        `As a freelancer I coached and mentored my padawans (ehm I mean, my students) about DevOps principles and practices. I also helped companies to improve their DevEx and DevOps approach.`,
        `In the time I've been in the IT industry, up and down since 2015, I've learned a lot from hands on experience and had the opportunity to interact with truly amzing people.`,
        `In 2023 I took the next step and I've been the CTO of a startup for one year, where I enjoyed the challenge of building a new company culture, services and products from scratch and of course taking care of my team.`,
        `In the end we could not find the Product-Market Fit and had to step back, but quoting Yoda: "The greatest teacher, failure is."`,
        `In 2024 I'll try to move, possibly away from Europe and hopefully starting a new exciting adventure in the software industry!`,
        `A few other facts about me: I've been a remote worker 🏝️ and a Hybrid Digital Nomad™ for quite a while ✈️🏡️ I enjoyed living and working in different timezones but now I'm looking for a place to finally call home.`,
        `I'm a combat sport amateur (boxe, K1, muay thai, bjj, MMA) 🥊 a musician/metal singer 🎹 and a passionate gamer 🕹️.`,
        `Huge fan of Star Wars 🌌 and Lord of The Rings ⚔️. I play D&D 🎲 and you can always find me cooking a good old italian meal 🍝.`,

        `My main goal as a professional is to contribute to great products and improving DevEx wherever I go!`,
        `In time I built strong bonds with employers, clients and colleagues. I always believed in trust and transparency as the foundation of each and every of these relationships.`,
        `I always valued communication over control, dialog rather than command, good design instead of "as long as it works", leaving a legacy above making myself indispensable, being safe more than being sorry, and (try) being always kind not always right.`,
        `I enabled companies to craft quality software because not only we were working toghether but our efforts were built to last and so they are.`,
        `What do I like most of my job until now?`,
        `Staying updated about new technology and trends, gaining insights numbers and metrics, learning and avdocating for good practices but above all: creating something meaningful, with a positive impact on people and planet Earth.`,
