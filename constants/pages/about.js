        `I was always passionate about computers and technology, but I started to code when I was 15, after switching highschool from a scientific and mostly theoretical one to what in Italy is called "technical" highschool, where I learned the basics of programming and computer science. 👨‍💻`,
        `I was never a good student, I was always bored by school 🥱 and I never liked to study, but I was always curious and I loved to learn new things, especially if they were related to computers.`,
        `My professors at that time used to tell me that I would never work in IT because I was not good enough, but I never gave up and I kept learning on my own. 🤓`,
        `Most people in my life were also not happy about my choice, they wanted me to go to university and get a degree to go for a "real job" 🤨 instead of "playing with computers", but I was not interested in that, I wanted to work and learn by doing, not by studying.`,
        `I started my journey in 2015 as a web developer while still in high school, I started to write production grade PHP code even before I got my driving license. 🚗`,
        `As employee I started as fullstack, in a small company building embedded software in C and some intarnal tools in C#, then I joined a promising local startup, always as fullstack but back to PHP with a Laravel flavor.`,
        `Graduating from my highschool I then moved to a bigger city (Milan), switched language to specialize in Java and built my back(end) as a Software Engineer, I climbed the ladder, worked on large scale products (8+ million users) and finally became a Senior Software Engineer. 👷`,
        `I am a fundamentally lazy person so I learnt to love automation, starting with bash scripts and moving on to DevOps tools, creating internal products with Python, Go, sometimes Ruby and tons of YAML configs.`,
        `I joined the Dark Side of DevOps and Site Reliability taking the best from my SWE background (I've never stopped to use the --force). 🌌`,
        `At some point, after leading DevOps initatives and bringing multiple teams from 0 to GitOps, I felt that I reached a ceiling in my career both in the company I worked at that time and in Italy. That is the reason why I decided to start my journey in 2021 as a freelance professional and digital nomad. ✈️🏝️`,
        `I wanted to scale my impact on the IT industry and to help more people and companies to achieve their goals. ⛰️`,
        `I coached and mentored my padawans (ehm I mean, my students) about DevOps principles and practices. I also helped companies to improve their DevEx and DevOps approach. 📚`,
        `In the meantime I learnt a bit more about frontend, especially React. I always despised Javascript but after learning about Typescript I started to like it a bit more. Still not my jam but I can live with it. Nodejs is more fun than I expected, I'll give you that. 🙆‍♂️`,
        `Back to the story, in all this time I've been in the IT industry, I've learned a lot from hands on experience and had the opportunity to interact with truly amazing people. 🤝`,
        `After digital nomading across Europe, in 2023 I took the next step and I've become the CTO of a startup for one year, where I enjoyed the challenge of building a new company culture, a service and a product from scratch and of course taking care of my team. 🤟`,
        `In the end we could not find the Product-Market Fit and had to step back, but quoting Yoda: "The greatest teacher, failure is."`,
        `I keep advocating for Cloud Native technologies, I am a Kubernetes lover and part of the CNCF community. ☸️💙`,
        `I strongly believe in the power of Platform Engineering and k8s and I look forward to impact the IT industry with my work. 🏋️`,
        `What will I do in 2024 and beyond? Who knows! 🤩`,
        `To be continued...`,

        `My main goal as a professional is to contribute to great products and improving DevEx wherever I go!`,
        `In time I built strong bonds with employers, clients and colleagues. I always believed in trust and transparency as the foundation of each and every of these relationships.`,
        `I always valued communication over control, dialog rather than command, good design instead of "as long as it works", leaving a legacy above making myself indispensable, being safe more than being sorry, and (try) being always kind not always right.`,
        `I enabled companies to craft quality software because not only we were working toghether but our efforts were built to last and so they are.`,
