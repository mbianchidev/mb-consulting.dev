        `Well, you are right, you can do it yourself, but you will have to manage it yourself, and that's the problem.`,
        `Managing a server is also not easy, it requires a team of people who know what they are doing and who are able to manage it 24/7.`,
        `If you are a small company, you probably don't have the resources to manage a server, and if you are a big company, you probably have a team of people who are able to manage it, but you are probably paying them a lot of money.`,
        `The Cloud can be a great solution for both small and big companies, it allows you to scale up and down your services in a matter of minutes, it allows you to pay only for what you use and it allows you to focus on innovation.`,
        `First of all, we will understand what kind of Cloud you need, there are 3 main types of Cloud:`,
        `- Public Cloud`,
        `- Private Cloud`,
        `- Hybrid Cloud`,
        `Then we will design a migration and management plan that fits your needs. This is the most important part of the process, because it will allow you to compare different solution and understand which one is the best for your company.`,
        `The migration plan will be divided in 3 phases:`,
        `1. Assessment`,
        `2. Migration`,
        `3. Management`,
        `The assessment phase is aimed at understanding your current situation, remove any obstacles that could prevent the migration (trust me, there are plenty of them but we will find a way through), design the infrastructure, define strategies and policies and finally a migration roadmap.`,
        `The migration phase is the core of the operation, we will be moving your product to the Cloud, starting with a pilot team and product. I will be monitoring the progress and coordinating the activities in this phase.`,
        `The management phase is aimed at simplifying the management of your Cloud infrastructure by implementing utilities and automation.`,
        `Why didn't I mention any specific cloud providers?`,
