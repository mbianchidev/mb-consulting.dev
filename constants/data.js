        `My story was filled with monstrous bugs 🐞, amazing features ✨, large scale products ⛰️, many programming languages and frameworks 📚, huge infrastructures 🗼 and amazing colleagues 👨‍💻.`,
        `I changed my path from Software to the Dark Side by becoming a DevOps/SRE taking the best from both worlds (never stopped to use the --force).`,
        `I've started to coach and mentor my padawans (ehm I mean, fellow IT people) as I strongly believe that knowledge is the only way to grow both as a person and a professional.`, 
        `In the time I've been in the IT industry, since 2017, I've learned a lot from both experience and people. The same knowledge that made me the engineer I am today I'm now willing to share with you.`,
        `I've seen and made many mistakes along the way but always learnt from them. Quoting Yoda: "The greatest teacher, failure is."`,
        `That is the reason I decided to start my journey as a freelance: to help people and companies to learn from their mistakes instead of avoiding them.`,
        `A few other things about me: I'm a remote worker 🏝️ and a Hybrid Digital Nomad™ ✈️🏡️ This means I will be reliable even if we live and work in different timezones!`,
        `In the last few years I've developed a strong interest in the world of finance 💲, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.`,
        `I'm a combat sport amateur (boxe, K1, muay thai) 🥊 a musician/metal singer 🎹 and a passionate gamer 🕹️. I'm also a huge fan of Star Wars 🌌 and Lord of The Rings ⚔️. I play D&D 🎲 and cook italian dishes 🍝.`,
