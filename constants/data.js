      "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... I fell in ‚ù§Ô∏è with DevOps culture, I became passionate about clouds üå©Ô∏è and obsessed with IT security üîê. Always eager to learn and teach new stuff, to make a difference",
    description: [
      `I like to introduce myself as an agnostic and versatile engineer with a deep passion for code, automation and cloud technologies.`,
      `In time I've learned to coach and mentor people. I strongly believe that knowledge is the only way to get rid of technical debt and build game-changing digital products.`,
      `A few other things about me: I'm a remote worker üèùÔ∏è and a Certified Digital Nomad‚Ñ¢ ‚úàÔ∏èüè°Ô∏è This means I will still be reliable even if we live and work in different timezones!`,
      `My main goal is to enable DevOps culture in your company to add tons of value to your products and improve your developers experience.`,
      `In our time toghether we will build a strong bond, because trust is the foundation of every professional relationship.`,
      `I value communication over control, dialog rather than command, good design instead of "as long as it works", leaving a legacy above making myself indispensable, being safe more than being sorry, and being always kind not always right.`,
      `My framework enables your company to craft quality software because not only we are working toghether here and now but our efforts are going to be built to last.`,
      `What do I like most of my job?`, 
      `Recommending the fresh techs (always production-ready), automating \& optimizing your processes (yes, cost optimization included üí∏), spreading good practices and boosting your team(s) knowledge base so they become your dream team.`,
