# License

This project is under no license, do whatever, I don't mind :)
No guarantees, no warranties, no nothing.

# Deployment

Deployment is made of 3 steps.

- Login to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with your GitHub account
- Project -> Deploy
- Wait for Vercel to deploy your project to production and voil√†, really simple. I should write an article on that.

## Custom Domains
To configure a custom domain, bought outside Vercel, you need to change DNS in your as stated here: https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/custom-domains
Tip: it can take up to 48 hours, use: https://www.whatsmydns.net/ to check if your DNS change propagated everywhere and don't worry if your site seems not responding, it's probably a DNS issue.
